:: DocksInvestigation
You arrive at the docks just as the hustle of the early market begins. Blending into the crowd, you watch as workers unload various crates from a large vessel, marked with a discreet emblem you recognize as belonging to a trading company rumored to be a front for the empire&#39;s shadow operations. You need to act carefully here.

* [[Wait and follow the crates after they leave the docks|FollowCrates]]
* [[Try to sneak onto the ship for a closer look|SneakOntoShip]]:: DisguiseAtDocks
You slip away from the bustling crowd and find a quiet corner near the warehouses. Swiftly, you don an oversized coat and a battered hat discarded by a worker. Now looking the part, you ease back into the throng, your gaze fixed on the crates. As you draw nearer, you overhear snippets of conversation about a shipment destined for a colonial outpost, potentially linked to illegal arms.

[[Blend in and help unload crates to gather more information|HelpUnload]]
[[Eavesdrop on the conversation between two senior dock officials|EavesdropConversation]]:: FollowCrates
You follow the cart discreetly as it moves through the city, finally arriving at a secluded warehouse complex. Here, you gather that this location might be a hub for the empire&#39;s illicit trade.

[[Decide to investigate the warehouse further|InfiltrateWarehouse]]:: SneakOntoShip
Carefully, you slip onto the ship, avoiding the notice of the crew. Below deck, you find a cache of documents and maps that suggest the ship is involved in smuggling operations across the empire.

[[Take the documents and plan your next move|PlanNextWithDocuments]]
:: HelpUnload
You join a line of workers heaving crates onto the dock. Your ruse as a dockworker gets you closer to the action, and as you handle the crates, you notice several are unusually heavy and marked with coded symbols. Realizing these might contain the arms, you decide it&#39;s crucial to trace their destination.

[[Mark a crate subtly to track it later|MarkCrate]]
[[Steal documents from the foreman&#39;s office regarding the shipment|StealDocuments]]:: EavesdropConversation
Tucked behind a stack of barrels, you listen as the officials discuss the upcoming shipment. One of them mentions a high-ranking official&#39;s involvement in rerouting some of these supplies to a different location than planned, likely to support a covert military operation.

[[Confront the officials to glean more information|ConfrontOfficials]]
[[Record the conversation with a hidden device|RecordConversation]]
:: MarkCrate
Carefully, you scratch a small, discreet mark into the wood of one of the heavier crates. With this subtle identifier, you can now track its final destination through any intermediaries or changes in the logistics chain. After marking the crate, you cautiously retreat to a safe distance, watching as the crate is loaded onto a cart heading towards the city&#39;s warehouse district.

[[Follow the cart to see where it goes|FollowCart]]
[[Notify a contact in the police to tail the cart discreetly|NotifyContact]]:: StealDocuments

Among these, you find detailed cargo manifests and confidential letters that discuss the routing and security details of shipments linked to the imperial military efforts. The documents reveal plans to supply weapons to a rebellious faction in a colonial territory, implicating several high-ranking officials in a complex web of corruption and betrayal.

[[Use the documents to blackmail the officials involved|BlackmailOfficials]]
[[Secure copies of the documents and plan to publish them|PlanToPublish]]In a daring move, you decide to confront the officials directly at their clandestine meeting place. As you burst in, their initial shock gives way to a tense exchange. With no way out, they start blaming each other, revealing not just the planned rerouting of supplies but also implicating high-ranking officials in a broader scheme of embezzlement and bribes tied to defense contracts. Your recorder captures every word, providing you with explosive material for a major expose.

[[Prepare a detailed expos&#233; to unveil the corruption network|PrepareExpose]]
:: RecordConversation
Using a small, hidden recording device, you capture the officials&#39; conversation detailing the rerouting of supplies.

[[Use the recording to blackmail the officials|BlackmailWithRecording]]
[[Keep the recording for a decisive moment to reveal it publicly|KeepRecordingForReveal]]:: FollowCart
You keep a safe distance as you tail the cart through the winding streets of Port Meridian. The cart finally stops at a large, nondescript warehouse. As workers start unloading, you notice increased security—a sign that something valuable or illicit might be inside.
